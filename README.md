Coding Task 1: 
Convert the Matrix Multiplication program from Assignment 1 to 
parallel using OpenMP. Use your previous sequential submission as your starter code. 
(Make sure that your sequential version works as expected first) 
Then explain the following: 
• Compare the time with your pthread version. 
• Experiment with static, dynamic, and guided scheduling and report on the impact 
on performance with different matrix sizes.

Coding Task 2: 
Convert the sequential program numerical integration using 
trapezoidal rule to parallel using OpenMP. Use integrate.c as your starter code.

Task 3: Benchmark the time it took for your sequential and OpenMP versions for both 
tasks 1 and 2 using the table below:
